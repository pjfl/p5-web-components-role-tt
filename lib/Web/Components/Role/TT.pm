=head1 Name

Web::Components::Role::TT - Applies Template as Web::Component role

=head1 Synopsis

   use Moo;

   with 'Web::Components::Role';
   with 'Web::Components::Role::TT';

   $rendered_template = $self->render_template( $request_object, $stash );

=head1 Description

Uses L<Template> to render templates, typically producing a page of HTML.
It is meant to be used in conjunction with L<Web::Components> and
L<Web::ComposableRequest> as it's API assumes these are used

Templates are assumed to be encoded as C<utf8>

=head1 Configuration and Environment

Defines the following attributes;

=over 3

=item C<templates>

A lazily evaluated directory which defaults to F<templates> in the configuration
root directory. This is where the templates are stored

=back

=head1 Subroutines/Methods

=head2 C<render_template>

   $rendered_template = $self->render_template( $request_object, $stash );

The C<$request_object> is an instance of L<Web::ComposableRequest>. The
C<$stash> hash reference may contain a C<config> attribute if not the
invocant is expected to provide a C<config> object. The C<$stash> should
also contain C<skin> and C<page> attributes. The C<page> hash reference
should contain a C<layout> attribute

The path to the template file is F<< templates/<skin>/<layout>.tt >>. The
C<skin> and C<layout> attributes default to the values of the configuration
object

If the consuming class has a C<stash_template_functions> method it is called
passing in the C<request> and C<stash> arguments. It is expected that this
method will add code references to the stash that can be called from the
templates

=head1 Diagnostics

The compiled templates are stored in subdirectories below the configuration
temporary directory

# Name

Web::Components::Role::TT - Applies Template as Web::Component role

# Synopsis

    use Moo;

    with 'Web::Components::Role';
    with 'Web::Components::Role::TT';

    $rendered_template = $self->render_template( $stash );

# Description

Uses [Template](https://metacpan.org/pod/Template) to render templates, typically producing a page of HTML.
It is meant to be used in conjunction with [Web::Components](https://metacpan.org/pod/Web::Components) and
[Web::ComposableRequest](https://metacpan.org/pod/Web::ComposableRequest) as it's API assumes these are used

Templates are assumed to be encoded as `utf8`

# Configuration and Environment

Defines the following attributes;

- `templates`

    A lazily evaluated directory which defaults to `templates` in the configuration
    root directory. This is where the templates are stored

    The path to the template file is `templates/<skin>/<layout>.tt`. The
    `skin` and `layout` attributes default to the values of the configuration
    object

# Subroutines/Methods

## `render_template`

    $rendered_template = $self->render_template( $stash );

The `$stash` hash reference may contain a `config` attribute, otherwise the
invocant is expected to provide a `config` object. The `$stash` should also
contain `skin` and `page` attributes. The `page` hash reference should
contain a `layout` attribute

# Diagnostics

The compiled templates are stored in subdirectories below the configuration
temporary directory
